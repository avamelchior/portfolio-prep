## Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

My name is Ava Melchior, and I am a 20 year old software developer from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I come from a background of piano performance and music composition, which allows me to bring many new and different ideas to the table. To me, programming is so much more than just lines of code. It's creativity, it's art, it's not so different from composing a piece of music. There is structure, yet there is freedom and liberties which can be taken. I use the perspective I have to tailor my work to each individual's needs and aesthetic values, to give people access to websites which set them apart from the rest with a balance of friendly user interface and boundless individuality.
